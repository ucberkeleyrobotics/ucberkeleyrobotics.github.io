                        <p>In the words of their website, <a href="http://www.mpc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">mpc.berkeley.edu</a>,</p>
                        <p>“Our research lab focuses on the theoretical and real-time implementation aspects of constrained predictive model-based control. We deal with linear, nonlinear and hybrid systems in both small scale and complex large scale applications. Our contributions include the discovery of fundamental theoretical results, the development of novel control algorithms and their experimental validation carried out with the help of coworkers from industries and universities. We deal with a wide range of systems in the automotive field, in the process industries and in robotics, including several full scale industrial problems.”.</p>
