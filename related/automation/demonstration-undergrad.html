                        <p><i>Information provided by Michael Laskey, 10/1/15</i></p>

                        <p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
                        <p>Recent algorithmic advances in learning from demonstration has created a way to learn different tasks without any prior information. These model free approaches have been shown to be successful in a number of applications such as playing video games, flying a quadcopter and recently learning surgical subtasks.  We are interested in studying both adaptations to the machine learning algorithms and the psychology of teaching. This work builds on our most recent paper submission: http://berkeleyautomation.github.io/shiv/</p>
                        <p>Students working on the project will help with:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Performing Human Robot Interaction experiments</li>
                            <li>Designing Experiments to help test different learning algorithms</li>
                            <li>Integrating deep learning architectures into current experiments</li>
                            <li>Launching experiments in the cloud to learn on a large dataset</li>
                            <li>Creating environments for learning in physics simulator</li>
                            <li>Analyzing the theoretical implications of the learning algorithms</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This work will help us answer the future research questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How should a human provide feedback to a robot?</li>
                            <li>Can a student robot teach the human new skills?</li>
                            <li>Can a robot learn in simulation first and then work with a human in the real world?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We have a successful history of mentoring undergraduates so far. Our first set of undergraduate researchers got working on an independent project within a year, and their work later appeared in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/science/new-research-center-aims-to-develop-second-generation-of-surgical-robots.html?_r=1&utm_content=bufferf639f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer">New York Times</a>. Dex-Net 1.0 was also largely built by undergraduate researchers. We encourage applicants of all backgrounds to apply!</p>
