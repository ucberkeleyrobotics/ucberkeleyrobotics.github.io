                        <h3>Posted by Jeff Mahler - <a mailto="jmahler@berkeley.edu">jmahler@berkeley.edu</a></h3>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
                        <p>Large datasets of images and human speech, along with advances in parallel computing, have enabled recent results in image classification and speech recognition that outperform decades of previous research and, in some cases, human ability. The Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) is a project that aims to answer the question: will Big Data and Parallel Computation lead to the same scaling effects for robotic grasping and manipulation?</p>
                        <p>Over the summer we developed Dex-Net 1.0, a dataset of over 30,000 3D object models from the web labelled with robotic grasps and a Cloud-based system to launch up to 1,500 virtual instances at once for learning to predict grasp success. Our current experiments suggest that more data enables faster learning of robust grasps.</p>
                        <p>We are looking for one or two motivated students to help make the following improvements to our system:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Designing a new Cloud-based data storage system that can easily be updated with the outcomes of new experiments.</li>
                            <li>Integrating deep learning with the current system.</li>
                            <li>Integrating the system with a physical robot.</li>
                            <li>Redesign of our Cloud-launching system to easily search over parameters.</li>
                            <li>Adding additional data sources and cleaning the data.</li>
                            <li>Reorganizing the codebase for a potential future open-access release of the project.</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>This work will help us answer the future research questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can deep learning be used to predict robotic grasps?</li>
                            <li>Can we quickly find a set of grasps that "cover" an object surface, to enable grasp selection at runtime in the presence of obstacles (e.g. a cluttered table)?</li>
                            <li>Can we transfer knowledge from analytic grasping models or simulation to the physical world?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We have a successful history of mentoring undergraduates so far. Our first set of undergraduate researchers got working on an independent project within a year, and their work later appeared in the New York Times. Dex-Net 1.0 was also largely built by undergraduate researchers. We encourage applicants of all backgrounds to apply!</p>
