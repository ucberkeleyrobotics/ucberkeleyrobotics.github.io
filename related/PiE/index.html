                        <p>Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) is a student outreach organization at UC Berkeley. Their goal is to make STEM programs more accessible to K-12 students, especially those in underprivileged school districts in the Bay Area. The members of PiE achieve this by 1. creating and teaching hands-on STEM lessons at multiple schools throughout the Bay Area and 2. organizing and hosting a high school competition that allows students to put the STEM skills theyâ€™ve learned to the test with an extensive hands-on design experience.</p>
                        <p>UC Berkeley students who join PiE can participate in a variety of activities which include designing robotics parts, creating STEM curricula, teaching K-12 students, and managing events. We highly encourage students interested in using robotics as a tool for education to check out PiE!
