                        <p><b>Description:</b></p>
                        <p>As stated on his lab’s website, Dr. Kazerooni conducts research on “robotics, control sciences, exoskeletons, human-machine systems and augmentation, bioengineering, mechatronics design, artificial locomotion, intelligent assist devices, and power and propulsion.” His work aims to lower the mobility and object transportation issues that humans encounter.</p>
                        <p>Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX), ExoHiker™, and ExoClimber™ were three of his notable exoskeletons projects that eventually lead to the creation of Human Universal Load Carrier (HULC), a energetically-independent lower exoskeleton allowed users to relocate 200-pound loads regardless of terrain. It includes features from ExoHiker™ and ExoClimber™. A video of HULC can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XrwGDjOuOs#t=25">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>In previous work focusing instead on upper extremities, his team created a new class of intelligent assistive devices now being used worldwide to assist workers with manipulations of heavy devices, which can be found <a href="http://bleex.me.berkeley.edu/research/intelligent-assist-devices/">here</a>.</p>
