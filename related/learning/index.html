                        <p><b>Description:</b></p>
                        <p>Located of the 7th floor of Sutardja Dai Hall (SDH), the Robot Learning Lab focuses on deep learning with the target application of autonomous manipulation. Deep learning is not the only method of harnessing an ever-increasing pool of data, but more traditional approaches tend to plateau at particular levels of performance. According to Abbeel, deep learning is “the first, and currently only, machine learning approach that has demonstrated the ability to continue to improve performance on real world problems as more data and more compute cycles are being made available.” This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtMyH_--vnU">video</a> by a post-doc covers recent work from his research group.</p>
                        <p>In deep learning, or supervised learning, systems receive inputs (such as images) and corresponding labels (such as ‘dog,’ ‘cat,’ etc.) or actions. Initial performance may be low, but after periods of trial and error, systems label or react to inputs with increased accuracy and efficiency. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=49&v=S2GAz5F03Ls">talk</a> by Abbeel covers machine learning and optimization.</p>
