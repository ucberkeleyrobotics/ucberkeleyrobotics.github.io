			<h3>Welcome to the <b>Robotics at Berkeley</b> website!</h3>
			<p>We are a student group at UC Berkeley that lowers the barriers to being involved in robotics at Cal by doing the following things:
			<li>Supporting other students' robotics projects by helping them get the money, space, tools, and advising they need.</li>
			<li>Increasing awareness and accessibility of all robotics-related groups on campus by collecting and distributing information about different robotics organizations and events in and around UC Berkeley.</li>
			<li>Organizes social and intellectual events focused on robotics and related technologies.</li>
			<br>
			<p>We encourage you to explore our website! Especially be sure to check out our <a href="http://calrobotics.xyz/related">Also at Cal</a> page if you want to discover all the different groups involved in robotics at UC Berkeley.</p>
