			<h3>Welcome to the <b>Cal Robotics Team</b> website!</h3>
			<!-- <p>So maybe you feel nostalgic about your High School days, during which you tinkered for hours on end in lab in preparation for your local robotics championship. Or maybe you've been doing research in the field of Artificial Intelligence or Computer Vision and want to put your skills to the test on a fun recreational side project. No matter what your goals or background may be, The Cal Robotics Team is the perfect place for you!</p> -->
			<p>We design, fabricate, and program robots for both recreation and competition. Our first mission this year will be creating a large combat robot for RoboGames 2016, and we'll be adding more exciting projects soon!</p>
