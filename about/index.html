<<<<<<< HEAD
			<p>Founded in the summer of 2015 by Berkeley EECS and Mechanical Engineering undergraduates who share a passion for hands-on engineering design, we strive to not only increase the accessibility of materials needed to build robots but also to increase awareness about the immensity and diversity of robotics at Cal. We bring together students interested robotics through intense competitions, recreational projects, community events, and social events.</p>
			<p>The student engineers in our club exhibit interdisciplinary, hands-on skill sets that reflect the diverse nature of robotics. Our members can code in a plethora of programming languages, utilize software such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD to model and simulate machines, design complex and powerful electrical systems, and perhaps most importantly, can all work on teams to achieve difficult goals.</p>
			<p>Robotics is a hugely exciting and relevant field at this point in human history, and the members of this club are excited to become leaders in the field!</p>

			<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
			<p>There are a ton of ways that you can help us out! Here are some of the things that you can assist with.</p>
			<p>As a member of our <b>Mechanical Team</b>, you will assist with things like the suspension, controls, and motors of the robot</p>
			<p>On our <b>Electrical Team</b>, you will do things like design the circuit of the robot and ensure that electrical connections are soldered properly.</p>
			<p>Our <b>Strategy Team</b> is also invaluable to the quality of our robot, as the team does things like telemetry, system monitoring, programming, and other tasks to ensure our robot runs as efficiently as possible.</p>
			<p>Lastly, our <b>Operations Team</b> handles everything from corporate sponsorships to the team's finances. It ensures that the team can continue being well-funded for years to come.</p>

		<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
		<p>The mission of the Cal Robotics Team is to provide a community that openly offers equipment, project funding, and inspiration to UC Berkeley students interested in robotics or in the disciplines that contribute to the field of robotics. We strive to be an organization in which students can explore their own ideas, connect with peers who hold similar interests, build their organizational and communication skills, and hone their abilities to design and build complex machines.</p>
