		<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
		<p>The mission of the Cal Robotics Team is to provide a community that openly offers equipment, project funding, and inspiration to UC Berkeley students interested in robotics or in the disciplines that contribute to the field of robotics. We strive to be an organization in which students can explore their own ideas, connect with peers who hold similar interests, build their organizational and communication skills, and hone their abilities to design and build complex machines.</p>
