                        <p>RoboGames is an annual competition for roboticists of all ages, often called the “Olympics of Robotics”. Their headline event is the epic Combat league in which battle robots equipped with giant saws, flamethrowers, pneumatic launchers, sledgehammers, and other weapons literally fight to the death.</p>
                        <p>We’ll be competing in the 60-lb combat division at RoboGames against other colleges and adult teams. This is our first large project as a club, and it will certainly be an exciting one! Creating a successful combat robot will involve extensive mechanical and electrical system design. We’ll be using MATLAB, Solidworks, and other software extensively during the design and testing of our robot.</p>
