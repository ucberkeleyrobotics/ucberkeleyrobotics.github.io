                        <p>In Cal Robotics, we do a number of things, including connecting our club members with Robotics Resouces around campus and conducting our social activities. However, our main purpose is to do <b>projects</b>, both competetive and recreational. In this upcoming school year, you will have the opportunity to do your own projects. Want to start your own?
